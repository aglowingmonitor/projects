# Projects

All of my projects mashed together into one github repo.
Contains all the languages I use or have tried at some point. Still uploading a bunch of things so some langs aren't here yet.

**Note some projects are old and most likely contain security vulnerabilities from outdated plugins.**
**Unless you know how to fix them it's probably best not to use these in a real world case.**

Some of the projects are newer and shouldn't have major vulns in them. Therefore they should be just fine.
